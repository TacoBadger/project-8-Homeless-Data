Welcome to our Homelessness Dataset Introduction! This overview helps you explore the complex issue of homelessness in the United States. Through data analysis and visual aids, we aim to shed light on the challenges faced by homeless individuals, their stories, and the factors contributing to this issue.

## Homelessness
Welcome to our Homelessness Dataset Introduction! We're here to help you learn about homelessness in the United States. We'll use data and pictures to show the challenges faced by people without stable homes and how we can make things better.

## What is Homelessness?
Homelessness is when people don't have a safe place to live. Some sleep on the streets, some stay in shelters, and some don't have a home at all.

## What the Data Tells Us
Our dataset is like a big puzzle showing homelessness from 2007 to 2016. We can see things like how many people don't have homes, reasons for homelessness, and where it happens the most.

## Why This Matters
Understanding homelessness helps us make good choices. By looking at the data, we can:
- See Changes: Find out how homelessness is different over time.
- Make Rules: Use facts to create better laws and help people.
- Tell Stories: Show everyone how important this issue is and inspire them to help.
- Bring Hope: Share stories of people who need help to make a difference.

## What We Want to Learn
We're digging into the data to answer questions like:
- What causes homelessness in different places?
- How has long-term homelessness changed?
- Who's most affected by this problem?
- How many homeless people are in each state?
- Did homelessness go up from 2007 to 2016?
- How many people don't have homes in the whole US?

By addressing these questions, we seek to gain insights into the distribution of homelessness across states, understand how the homeless population has changed over the specified time period, and ascertain the overall magnitude of homelessness in the country.

## Visual
We've turned this data into pictures that tell stories. Here are a couple:

**Homeless by State**


Among the states included in the dataset, California (CA) stands out as the most significantly affected by homelessness. The data suggests that California consistently experiences higher numbers of homeless individuals across various measures, such as "Chronically Homeless Individuals," "Homeless Individuals," and "Homeless People in Families." Following California, Florida (FL) emerges as the second most affected state, with notable numbers of homeless individuals as well. New Jersey (NJ), New York (NY), and Michigan (MI) also exhibit considerable homelessness, albeit to a slightly lesser extent compared to California and Florida. It's important to emphasize that these conclusions are based on the provided dataset's from 2007 to 2016

**Homeless,Sheltered Homeless by Count**


it becomes evident that the "sheltered homeless" category has the highest count.
The "unsheltered homeless" category follows, pointing to individuals who lack proper shelter and are forced to endure homelessness on the streets or in inadequate conditions.
The dataset also sheds light on the "chronically homeless" subgroup, individuals experiencing persistent homelessness often coupled with severe health issues.
the count of "homeless veterans" draws attention to the challenges faced by those who have served in the military and are now grappling with homelessness.
In summary, the dataset reveals a multifaceted picture of homelessness, ranging from those who have accessed shelter and support services to those who remain unsheltered and face more chronic and complex challenges.

**Sum of Homeless per Year**

Examining the provided dataset spanning from 2007 to 2016., it becomes evident that there have been fluctuations in the prevalence of long-term homelessness over time across different states and Continuums of Care (CoCs). By focusing on the counts of chronically homeless individuals – those experiencing homelessness for an extended period – we can discern some patterns

**Total Homeless by State**

the data suggests that homelessness is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including demographics, economic conditions, available support services, housing affordability, and local policies. By delving into these data-driven insights, we can develop targeted strategies to address homelessness and provide assistance to those in need in various places across the USA.



## What We Discovered
Our research found some cool things:
- Big cities have more homelessness.
- Some groups, like veterans and young people, struggle more.
- Homelessness changes with seasons and important events.
- No jobs, no homes, and health problems lead to homelessness.

We hope that by sharing this information, we can help everyone understand and care about homelessness in the USA. Let's work together to make things better for people who don't have a place to call home.
